This repository will consist of all Java projects related to the Spring Data Framework, more specifically, about the Jakarta Persistence API dependency.

All the projects here utilize in some way, the JPA combined with some database language to fetch or alter data.

# Project 1 17/10 | JPA Creating Data in H2
This Project was made for the introduction of the Jakarta Persistence API. We used it combined with H2. During the class we inserted some users and fetch then.

After the class I saw a little more about, and with the help of a Spring JPA Tutorial could insert a search through Customer ID and Customer Last Name.


# Project 2 18/10 | EntityManager in H2
Today we used the principles learned in the last project to go a little further in the Spring Data JPA. We also inserted users to the H2 Database, but this time used a component named EntityManager, it helped us to created our own CRUD operations. We inserted, fetched, altered and removed users through the EntityManager and CommandLineRunner.

# Project 3 19/10 | Relating Tables in H2
The project I made today was focused on create a relational database for a book store, we saw about the components responsible for relating tables, cardinality and more about the principles and basic components available in JPA.
We renamed tables and created differente methods to use while the project was executed.
